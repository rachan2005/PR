# AI-Powered Urban Traffic Management System

An end-to-end AI/ML system that ingests live data (cameras, sensors, GPS) to predict bottlenecks, adjust signal timings, and deliver optimized route guidance.

## Key Objectives

- Cut travel times ≥20% by dynamically tuning lights and guiding drivers
- Balance flow across all corridors to avoid hotspots
- Reduce idle emissions through signal optimization and rerouting
- Offer real-time routes via navigation integration

## System Components

### 1. Traffic Prediction

- Input: historical + live data (volume, speed, occupancy)
- Models: LSTM or ARIMA for time-series forecasting

### 2. Adaptive Signal Control

- Algorithm: reinforcement learning (Q-learning / DQN)
- Output: dynamic green-time allocations per intersection

### 3. Route Optimization

- Technique: shortest-path reweighting using current/predicted delays
- Integration: API hooks for navigation apps
