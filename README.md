# AI-Powered Urban Traffic Management System

An end-to-end AI/ML system that ingests live data from cameras, sensors, and GPS to predict traffic bottlenecks, adaptively control traffic signals, and provide optimized routing to reduce congestion and travel times.

## Key Features

- **Traffic Prediction**: LSTM models for time-series forecasting of traffic conditions
- **Adaptive Signal Control**: Reinforcement learning (DQN) for optimizing traffic light timings
- **Route Optimization**: Graph-based algorithms for finding the best routes considering real-time conditions
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for integration with navigation apps and traffic management systems
- **Simulation Environment**: Built-in traffic simulation for testing and evaluation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pip package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic_management.git
cd traffic_management
```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Simulation

To run the traffic simulation:

```bash
python run_simulation.py --config configs/default.json --visualize
```

Command line options:

- `--config`: Path to configuration file (default: configs/default.json)
- `--duration`: Simulation duration in seconds (overrides config)
- `--vehicles`: Number of vehicles (overrides config)
- `--random-seed`: Random seed for reproducibility (overrides config)
- `--visualize`: Generate visualization of results
- `--log-level`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

### Running the API Server

To run the API server:

```bash
python run_api.py
```

Command line options:

- `--config`: Path to configuration file (default: configs/default.json)
- `--host`: API host (overrides config)
- `--port`: API port (overrides config)
- `--debug`: Run in debug mode with auto-reload
- `--log-level`: Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/v1/traffic/status`: Get current traffic status
- `POST /api/v1/traffic/prediction`: Predict future traffic conditions
- `POST /api/v1/signals/control`: Get recommended signal control for an intersection
- `POST /api/v1/routes/optimize`: Get optimized routes between origin and destination

## Implementation Details

### Traffic Prediction

The system uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks to predict traffic volume, speed, and congestion levels. Historical and real-time data from various sources are processed and fed into the model to generate predictions for different time horizons.

### Adaptive Signal Control

Traffic signals are controlled using a Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithm. The model learns to optimize signal timings based on traffic conditions to minimize waiting times and maximize throughput at intersections.

### Route Optimization

The route optimization component uses graph algorithms (Dijkstra/A\*) to find the shortest paths considering current and predicted traffic conditions. The system can suggest multiple alternative routes to balance traffic across the network.

## Expected Impact

- 20%+ reduction in travel times
- Decreased idling and emissions
- Improved commuter satisfaction
- Modular design allows expansion to new regions

## Future Work

- Integration with connected vehicle systems
- Enhanced computer vision for traffic detection
- Multi-modal transportation support
- Coordination with public transit systems
